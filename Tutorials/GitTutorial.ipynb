    "The most simple way to think of version control, is that it is just nodes with lines connecting them\n",

    "![Image](Figures/git_branch.png){width=\"1000,\" }\n",
    "\n",
    "Each node, which we call a *commit* is uniquely identified by a hash string. Each node, stores what our code\n",
    "looked like at that point in time (when we made the commit) and using the hash codes we can easily\n",
    "revert to a specific point in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The commits are made up of local changes that we make to our code. A basic workflow for\n",
    "adding commits are seen below\n",
    "\n",
    "![Image](Figures/git_structure.PNG){width=\"1000,\" }\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that we have made some changes to our local *working directory* and that we\n",
    "want to get these updates to be online in the *remote repository* we have to do the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* First we run the command `git add`. This will move our changes to the *staging area*. While changes are in the\n",
    "    staging area we can very easily revert them (using `git restore`). There have therefore not been assigned a unique\n",
    "    hash to the code yet, and we can therefore still overwrite it.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To take our code from the *staging area* and make it into a commit, we simply run `git commit` which will locally\n",
    "    add a note to the graph. It is important again, that we have not pushed the commit to the online *repository* yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finally, we want others to be able to use the changes that we made. We do a simple `git push` and our\n",
    "    commit gets online\n",

    "Of course, the real power of version control is the ability to make branches, as in the image below\n",

    "\n",
    "1. In your GitHub account create an repository, where the intention is that you upload a file \"file.py\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. After creating the repository, clone it to your computer\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```bash\n",
    "        git clone https://github.com/my_user_name/my_repository_name.git\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Move/copy the file you created  into the repository (and any other that you want)\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Add the file to a commit by using `git add` command\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Commit the files using `git commit` command where you use the `-m` argument to provide a commit message (1).\n",
    "        { .annotate }\n",
    "\n",
    "        1. :man_raising_hand: Writing good commit message is a skill in itself. A commit message should be short but\n",
    "            informative about the work you are trying to commit. Try to practise writing good commit messages\n",
    "            throughout the course. You can see\n",
    "            [this guideline](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/git-commit-message) for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Finally push the files to your repository using `git push`. Make sure to check online that the files have been\n",
    "        updated in your repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. You can always use the command `git status` to check where you are in the process of making a commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "    7. Also checkout the `git log` command, which will show you the history of commits that you have made.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Make sure that you understand how to make branches, as this will allow you to try out code changes without\n",
    "    messing with your working code. Creating a new branch can be done using:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```bash\n",
    "    # create a new branch\n",
    "    git checkout -b <my_branch_name>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    Afterwards, you can use `git checkout` (1) to change between branches (remember to commit your work!)\n",
    "    Try adding something (a file, a new line of code etc.) to the newly created branch, commit it and\n",
    "    try changing back to master afterwards. You should hopefully see whatever you added on the branch\n",
    "    is not present on the main branch.\n",
    "    { .annotate}\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. :man_raising_hand: The `git checkout` command is used for a lot of different things in git. It can be used to\n",
    "        change branches, to revert changes and to create new branches. An alternative is using `git switch` and\n",
    "        `git restore` which are more modern commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. As a final exercise we want to simulate a *merge conflict*, which happens when two users try to commit changes\n",
    "    to exactly same lines of code in the codebase, and git is not able to resolve how the different commits should be\n",
    "    integrated.\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. In your browser, open your favorite repository (it could be the one you just worked on), go to any file of\n",
    "        your choosing and click the edit button (see image below) and make some change to the file. For example, if\n",
    "        you choose a Python file you can just import some random packages at the top of the file. Commit the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Make sure not to pull the change you just made to your local computer. Locally make changes to the same\n",
    "        file in the same lines and commit them afterwards.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Now try to `git pull` the online changes. What should (hopefully) happen is that git will tell you that it found\n",
    "        a merge conflict that needs to be resolved. Open the file and you should see something like this\n",
    "\n",
    "        ```txt\n",
    "        <<<<<<< HEAD\n",
    "        this is some content to mess with\n",
    "        content to append\n",
    "        =======\n",
    "        totally different content to merge later\n",
    "        >>>>>>> master\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "\n",
    "        this should be interpret as: everything that's between `<<<<<<<` and `=======` are the changes made by your\n",
    "        local commit and everything between `=======` and `>>>>>>>` are the changes you are trying to pull. To fix\n",
    "        the merge conflict you simply have to make the code in the two \"cells\" work together. When you are done,\n",
    "        remove the identifiers `<<<<<<<`, `=======` and `>>>>>>>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Finally, commit the merge and try to push.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. (VS Code & Git)  The above exercises have focused on how to use git from the terminal, which I highly recommend learning.\n",
    "    However, if you are using a proper editor they also have build in support for version control. We recommend getting\n",
